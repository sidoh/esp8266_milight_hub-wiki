When you get a bulb or lighting device that has not been paired with an existing controller, you can still use it with espMH.  You can choose a device ID arbitrarily and pair your device with it.  To do so, follow these instructions:

1. Power off the bulb or lighting device.  If it's a bulb, it's best to remove it from the socket entirely.
1. Choose a Device ID and enter it in the "Device ID" field in the UI.
1. Choose a Group ID to pair with.
1. Supply power to the bulb or lighting device.
1. Within five seconds, click on the "Pair" button in the UI.
1. The light should flash on and off a few times to indicate success.
